```

The HTML tags tells the browser that this is the root of the HTML

```html
<title>Basic HTML Lesson</title>
```

Title element tells the browser to display what is inbetween the tags in the tab or browser window.

The body element is a container that will be used for displaying all the visible content to the browser.

`! + tab` gives us boiler plate code

`alt + arrows (up or down)` will take what you highlighted and move it up or down.
